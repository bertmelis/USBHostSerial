# USBHostSerial

:construction: **Work in progress.** :construction:

The goal is to create an "Arduino Serial"-like interface for USB-to-UART devices, connected to your ESP32-S3 which acts as USB-host.

Based on the [virtual com port example from Espressif](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/usb/host/cdc/cdc_acm_vcp).
